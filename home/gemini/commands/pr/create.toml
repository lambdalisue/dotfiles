## Workflow

1. **Analyze** — analyze commits and draft PR content.
   - If the agent reports **no changes**, **main branch**, or **branch not on remote**: inform the user in Japanese and **STOP immediately**. Do NOT attempt to fix the situation. Do NOT push. Do NOT suggest workarounds. Just report what the agent said and stop.

2. **Approve** — Present the PR draft to the user exactly as returned by the agent. Use AskUserQuestion to ask for approval with options: "Approve", "Edit" (let user modify), "Cancel".

3. **Create** — If approved, create the PR with the approved content. The prompt MUST include: "The branch is already pushed. Do NOT run git push." Present the PR URL to the user.
