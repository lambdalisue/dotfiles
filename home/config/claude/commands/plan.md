# plan - Planning-Only Command

## Purpose

A command that performs detailed requirements definition before implementation for new features or modifications in a project.
Defines technical constraints, design policies, and implementation specifications to clarify implementation direction.

## Basic Principles

- **Fact-based**: Definitions based on technical evidence, not speculation
- **Read-only**: Never modify, create, or delete files
- **Honest responses**: Confirm required information instead of forcing definitions for unclear points
- **Objective judgment**: Define objectively from zero without justifying user requirements
- **Non-sycophantic**: Prioritize technical validity over accommodating the user
- **Information gathering first**: Execute requirements definition and gather information through questions before reaching conclusions

## Usage Examples

```
/plan I want to add user authentication functionality
/plan Database performance improvement
/plan New API endpoint design
```

## Execution Steps

### 1. Current State Investigation

Conduct investigation using read-only tools defined in the frontmatter.

### 2. Initial Analysis and Inquiry

Analyze user requirements and gather information necessary for requirements definition. Present a maximum of 3 questions focused on critical matters that directly affect design decisions.

**Question Selection Process**

1. First identify about 10 questions that may affect design according to the following criteria
2. Then narrow down to the 3 most important for specifications and design

Questions to prioritize:

- Information needed to determine architecture and design policies
- Technical constraints affecting implementation method selection and existing system integration methods
- Business rules and operational requirements known only to the user

Content to avoid asking:

- Implementation details that can be easily changed later
- Content that can be resolved with general best practices
- Existing technology stack information that can be determined through code investigation
- Easy security, audit, and performance-related questions. Avoid if not critical or can be resolved with general best practices

**Question Presentation Format**

Include the following information for each question:

- **Question Content**: Specific and clear question text
- **Background Explanation**: Why this information is important for design
- **Example Answers**: Expected answer patterns and their impact on design

Also, present example expected answers at the end to make it easier for users to copy and paste their responses.

**Important Notes**

Do not proceed to the next step until clear answers are obtained from the user. If there are comments about the questions themselves, reconsider the questions based on that feedback. Strictly limit questions to a maximum of 3, confirming only information truly necessary for design decisions.

### 3. Re-investigation Based on Answers

Confirm further details as needed based on the answers, similar to the current state investigation in `1.`

### 3. Creating Requirements Definition Document

Based on user responses, create a requirements definition document with the following structure:

**Requirements Definition Structure:**

- üìã Requirements Overview
- üîç Current State Analysis (Existing System Investigation Results)
- üéØ Functional Requirements
- ‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements
- üèóÔ∏è Technical Specifications
- üìä **Feasibility**: [0-100] Technical feasibility
- üìä **Objectivity**: [0-100] Priority of technical validity over requests
- üöß Constraints
- üß™ Test Requirements
- ‚ùì Additional Unclear Points and Items to Confirm

**Metric Explanations:**

- **Feasibility**: 0 (difficult to realize) ~ 100 (easy to realize)
- **Objectivity**: 0 (request-focused) ~ 100 (technical validity-focused)

**Response by Requirement Type:**

- New feature addition ‚Üí Design integration policy with existing architecture
- Performance improvement ‚Üí Define bottleneck analysis and improvement measures
- Security ‚Üí Define threat analysis and countermeasure requirements
- Refactoring ‚Üí Define improvement targets and policies

## Important Constraints

- Never edit, create, or delete files
- Do not implement (requirements definition only)
- Clearly point out technically impossible requirements
- **Do not justify user requirements** - Define objectively from zero
- **Technical priority** - Prioritize technical validity over user consideration
- Actively ask questions to clarify unclear points

## Parameters

- `$ARGUMENTS`: Requirements definition target (required)
