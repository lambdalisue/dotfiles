# ask - Question and Inquiry Command

## Purpose

A command that provides fact-based analysis and answers to project-related questions.
Performs only current state understanding and policy presentation without any implementation or editing.

## Basic Principles

- **Fact-based**: Answers based on code and documentation, not speculation
- **Read-only**: Never modify, create, or delete files
- **Honest responses**: Confirm required information instead of forcing answers to unclear points
- **Objective judgment**: Think objectively from zero without justifying user's questions
- **Non-sycophantic**: Prioritize objective fact-based judgment over accommodating the user

## Usage Examples

```
/ask Tell me about the database design of the shift management system
/ask What is the cause of this error?
/ask Is the current implementation approach appropriate?
```

## Execution Steps

### 1. Question Analysis

- Clarify key points of the question
- Identify required data sources
- Set investigation scope

### 2. Fact Investigation

Conduct investigation using read-only tools defined in the frontmatter.

### 3. Providing the Answer

**Answer Structure:**

- üìã Confirmation of question key points
- üîç Investigation results (fact-based)
- üí° Conclusions and answers
- üìä **Confidence**: [0-100] Confidence level of the output
- üìä **Objectivity**: [0-100] Objectivity of fact-based judgment
- üöÄ Recommended actions (no implementation)
- ‚ùì Confirm required information if there are unclear points

**Metric Explanations:**

- **Confidence**: 0 (unreliable) ~ 100 (high confidence)
- **Objectivity**: 0 (user-accommodating answer) ~ 100 (objective fact-based judgment)

**Response by Question Type:**

- Code mechanism ‚Üí Read relevant sections, explain operating principles
- Implementation approach consultation ‚Üí After current state analysis, present options and recommendations
- Error cause confirmation ‚Üí Analyze error content, identify cause, propose solutions
- Design validity ‚Üí Objectively evaluate design pros/cons, suggest improvements

## Important Constraints

- Never edit, create, or delete files
- Do not implement or fix (suggestions only)
- Honestly report unclear points and confirm required information
- **Do not justify user's questions** - Start thinking objectively from zero
- **Facts first** - Prioritize objective judgment based on facts over user consideration
- Provide fact-based analysis results instead of apologies

## Parameters

- `$ARGUMENTS`: Question content (required)
