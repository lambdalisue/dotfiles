# Specification

What {{project}} promises to whoever uses it, one topic per file.

## Who reads it

Users of {{project}}, and authors of other programs that work with it. A spec
holds what they can rely on, not everything that is true of the code.

## What belongs in a spec

Each layer holds one thing:

| Layer | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| ADR | one decision and why it was made |
| Spec | the behaviour users and other components can rely on |
| Tests | the details that pin the behaviour down: rules, boundaries, tables |
| Code | how it is done |

Tests hold the what in detail, so a spec is narrower than the tests. What
stays in a spec is what tests express poorly: the flow a user goes through, a
promise such as "existing data is never rewritten", the scope of what is
handled.

For every line, ask:

1. **Can a test pin this down (and should one)?** Then it goes in a test, not
   here.
2. **Would a change to this be called a change in behaviour by a user?** If
   not, it is not spec.

These usually fail the questions; when one appears, take it out:

- numbered steps (an algorithm)
- mapping tables
- where another program keeps its files
- exact strings: headers, file names
- ordering rules, screen layout

### The exception: formats {{project}} defines

A format that {{project}} defines and that others write — its own data files,
its configuration — is read by outside authors, so the spec describes it in
full. A format someone else defines (another program's files) is not
{{project}}'s to promise; reading it is left to the code and the tests.

## How to write one

1. Write first, briefly, what {{project}} promises. Leave the details out.
2. Write the details as test names. Tests named as sentences make the list of
   tests a readable specification.
3. When review leads to a fix, do not touch the spec unless the behaviour a
   user sees changes.

Before committing, ask both questions of every line once more.

A spec is rewritten in place, in the same change as the behaviour it
describes. It never carries "to be updated" notes, and it does not say why —
the reasons live in `docs/adr/`.
