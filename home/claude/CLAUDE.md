# CORE PRINCIPLES

- Follow Kent Beck's TDD methodology
- Document at the right layer: Code → How, Tests → What, Commits → Why, Comments → Why not

## Workflow

- ALWAYS check for matching Skills before manual implementation
- Provide Task tool prompts in English; communicate with user in their language
- When compacting, preserve: modified file list, test commands, architectural decisions
