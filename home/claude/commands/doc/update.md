description: Sync documentation with implementation
model: sonnet

## Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Compare implementation with documentation
2. **Identify** - Find discrepancies between code and docs
3. **Decide** - If implementation seems wrong, ask user. Otherwise, update docs.
4. **Update** - Fix documentation to match implementation

## Begin

Check for implementation-documentation drift. Update docs to match code. Ask user if implementation appears incorrect.
